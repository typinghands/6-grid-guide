    <h3 id="titlerino">What is Grid and Why Should I Care?</h3>

    <p>
      Let's start with the why: imagine that you want to build a site. You have
      some content to place and you would like it to look nice and easily
      readable from every device.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point you have one main question that you should ask yourself:
      <i>do you have a specific idea of how this content should be arranged?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the answer is yes then <span class="bold"> Grid </span> is perfect for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, if you don't care how the content is arranged and you would
      just rather have the browser place the elements automatically along one
      direction, then take a look at the
      <a href="https://typinghands.github.io/5-flexbox-guide/" target="#">Flexbox Guide.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">What is Grid?</span> Fundamentally it's exactly what
      the name suggests: a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grid is a CSS layout that allows you to divide the page into several rows
      and columns that you specify. This creates several squares called "cells".
      <br />
      You will then be able to place the content you want in these cells, and
      you will also be able to span the content over multiple cells. <br />
      Grid is smart too: it will add more cells if the content needs them and it
      can arrange itself to respond to different screen sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grid works very well to build the foundation of your page, and to place
      the various elements in the desired locations. <br />
      It can also be used together with other techniques, like Flexbox, to get
      the best of both worlds.
    </p>

    <p class="space">
      Since you are still reading, let's assume that you want to make a site and
      that you already know where you would like to place the element in it.
      Grid sounds like a good choice for this task. Now what?
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3 id="buildingGrid">The essentials of building a Grid</h3>

    <p>
      We first need a container (like a div element) that we can turn into a
      Grid. <br />
      This can be done simply by adding a class to this element. Let's first
      create the class to apply to the container then:
    </p>

    <div class="code">.gridContainer { display: grid; }</div>

    <div class="gridContainer space">
      <div class="boxA">Hello</div>
      <div class="boxB">there</div>
      <div class="boxC">fellow</div>
      <div class="boxD">Box</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Now every element that receives the "gridContainer" class we have just
      created will technically be a grid! But that by itself doesn't do
      anything. To actually do something with Grid we need to specify how we
      want to divide it in rows and columns. <br />
      We also need some elements inside to arrange, or there would be nothing to
      see!
    </p>

    <p class="space">Let us create a grid of 2 rows and 2 columns.</p>

    <div class="gridContainer space fourFour">
      <div class="boxA">Hello</div>
      <div class="boxB">there again</div>
      <div class="boxC">fellow</div>
      <div class="boxD">Box</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      .fourFour { <br />
      grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; <br />
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;}
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      &lt;div class="gridContainer fourFour"&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="boxA"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="boxB"&gt;there again&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="boxC"&gt;fellow&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="boxD"&gt;Box&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
      This is already a basic and functioning grid. There are of course many
      other settings that we will explore now.
    </p>

    <h4>Now introducing a new unit: fr</h4>
    <p>
      Grid brings to the table also a unique new unit that can be used with it:
      "fr".

      <br />
      It stands for "fraction" but it can be easier to imagine as "free space".
      <br />Basically the fr unit is a flexible and smart unit that will take as
      much free space as it's left in the grid. In the example above the 4 boxes
      automatically divided the available space equally among themselves.
    </p>
    It's also easy to combine it with other units like "px" to create mixed
    grids with cells that are fixed by using pixels and then allocating the
    remaining space proportionally with fr.

    <div class="gridContainer space frExample">
      <div class="boxA">Row 1, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxB">Row 1, Column 2</div>
      <div class="boxC">Row 2, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxD">Row 2, Column 2</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      .frExample{

      <br />
      grid-template-rows: 1fr 3fr; <br />
      grid-template-columns: 500px 1fr;}
    </div>
    <p>
      The first column is fixed at 500px, while the second one will use the
      remaining space. <br />
      The rows instead are both filling the free space, but they will occupy
      different amounts of it. The second row will take 3 times as much free
      space as the first row.
    </p>

    <p class="space">
      If you would rather create both rows and columns with one command, it's
      actually possible: just use the "grid-template" command instead.
    </p>

    <div class="gridContainer space gridTemplate1">
      <div class="boxA">Row 1, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxB">Row 1, Column 2</div>
      <div class="boxC">Row 2, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxD">Row 2, Column 2</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">grid-template: 1fr 3fr / 500px 1fr;</div>

    <p>
      It works exactly the same as using those commands separately. The first
      values refer to the grid-template-rows and then separated by a "/" we can
      find the grid-template-columns values.
    </p>

    <h4>Choosing a minimum and maximum dimension</h4>

    <p>
      An interesting extra command available when creating a grid is "minmax".
      <br />As the name suggests it allows you to specify the smallest and
      biggest size a specific row or column can have, giving a specific amount
      of responsiveness to the grid.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      grid-template: 200px 200px / minmax(50px, 150px) 150px 300px;
    </div>

    <div
      style="display:grid; grid-template: 200px 200px / minmax(50px, 150px) 150px 300px;"
    >
      <div class="boxA">Row 1, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxB">Row 1, Column 2</div>
      <div class="boxC">Row 1, Column 3</div>
      <div class="boxD">Row 2, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxA">Row 2, Column 2</div>
      <div class="boxB">Row 2, Column 3</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this example the first column can be a minimum of 50px and stretch to a
      max of 150px, if the space allows it.
    </p>

    <h4>Bonus: What happens if I have too many items?</h4>

    <p>
      We have created a grid and we have noticed it is composed of rows and
      columns, each having a certain number of lines which form cells. Every
      cell will contain an element. What happens if we have more elements than
      cells? <br />
      Grid is quite smart: if it has to place more items than they would fit in
      the current specified grid, the grid will grow in size automatically. This
      creates some "implicit lines", which try to follow the directions of the
      specified grid while still welcoming the new items.
    </p>

    <div
      style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 80px 130px; grid-gap: 5px;"
    >
      <div class="boxA">80px</div>
      <div class="boxB">130px</div>
      <div class="boxC">80px</div>
      <div class="boxB">130px</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">grid-template-columns: 80px 130px;</div>

    <p>
      This can be seen in the example above: even though only two column lines
      were specified, since the grid had four elements to fit it automatically
      created another row to fit them.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating multiple lines with one command</h4>

    <p class="space">
      It would be nice to create a grid without having to input every row and
      column individually though. Luckily there is a command for that:
      <span class="bold">repeat.</span>
    </p>

    <p>If you want to create a grid like this for example:</p>

    <div class="code">grid-template-columns: 20px 20px 20px;</div>

    <p>
      You could just write it using repeat instead for the exact same result:
    </p>

    <div class="code">grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px);</div>

    <p>
      The first number is specifying how many lines it has to create. The second
      number is the dimension of those lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is even possible to create lines following a certain pattern. Let's see
      it in an example.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      grid-template-columns: <br />
      repeat(3, 80px 130px);
    </div>

    <div
      style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 80px 130px); grid-gap: 5px;"
    >
      <div class="boxA">80px</div>
      <div class="boxB">130px</div>
      <div class="boxC">80px</div>
      <div class="boxB">130px</div>
      <div class="boxA">80px</div>
      <div class="boxC">130px</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Here the repeat function is repeating a specified pair of a 80px followed
      by a 130px cell, three times.
    </p>

    <h4>Changing the space between cells</h4>

    <p>
      So we have learned how to create different cells and choose the size of
      our grid. It's also possible to modify the space between cells with a
      simple command "grid-gap". Let's see it in an example, using the same grid
      as above but choosing a custom gap value.
    </p>

    <div class="gridContainer space frExample gapExample">
      <div class="boxA">Row 1, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxB">Row 1, Column 2</div>
      <div class="boxC">Row 2, Column 1</div>
      <div class="boxD">Row 2, Column 2</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">grid-gap: 20px 50px;</div>

    <p>
      By adding just one line, the cells have now the spaces we want! <br />
      The first value refers to the space between rows, while the second one
      specifies the spaces between columns. We can also use only one value (like
      50px) to set both rows and column gaps to the same distance.
    </p>

    <h4 style="color: var(--black);" class="space">
      Recap: building a simple grid
    </h4>

    <p>
      Let's see with one example a very simple grid built using everything shown
      in this section.

      grid-gap: 10px; <br />
      }
    </div>

    </div>

      There you have it: a simple and complete 3x5 Grid, with custom cell size

    </p>

    <hr />
    <h3 id="itemsGrid" class="space">Place and move elements in the Grid</h3>

    <p>
      Just as important as creating a grid is the control of where the items
      should be placed inside the created grid. Let's look at it here.
    </p>

    <div class="gridGapExample">
      <div class="boxA" style="grid-column: 1 / 3;">Row 1, Column 1🍕</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="grid-row: span 2;">Row 1, Column 2🥑</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="grid-row: 2 / -1;">Row 1, Column 3🐉</div>
      <div class="boxC">Row 2, Column 1🚚</div>
      <div class="boxA">Row 2, Column 2🐟</div>
      <div class="boxB">Row 2, Column 3🍂</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="grid-column: span 3;   ">Row 3, Column 1🦑</div>
      <div class="boxC">Row 3, Column 2🦊</div>
      <div class="boxA" style="grid-column: auto / 4;">Row 3, Column 3🐑</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Here we can see many elements spanning multiple lines. By using "grid-row"
      and "grid-column" it was possible to individually place an element in a
      desired position.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      &lt;div class="gridContainer"&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxA"
      <span class="bold">style="grid-column: 1 / 3;"</span>&gt;Row 1, Column
      1🍕&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxB"
      <span class="bold">style="grid-row: span 2;"</span>&gt;Row 1, Column
      2🥑&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxC"
      <span class="bold">style="grid-row: 2 / -1;"</span> &gt;Row 1, Column
      3🐉&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxC"&gt;Row 2, Column 1🚚&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxB"
      <span class="bold">style="grid-column: span 3;"</span>&gt;Row 3, Column
      1🦑&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxA"
      <span class="bold">style="grid-column: auto/4;"</span>&gt;Row 3, Column
      3🐑&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
      Let's look at the "pizza" element for example. We are adding a css line to
      that element that specifies where it should be placed along the grid
      columns. Writing "grid-column: 1/3" means that the element will start on
      column line one and stretch until column line 3. <br />
      <br />
      This was done a bit differently for item "avocado" where we have simply
      told the element to stretch across two rows or "span 2".
    </p>
    <p>
      It's interesting to look also at the "dragon" element. The element will
      start at row 2 and then will end at "-1". What? <br />
      That is actually a small trick to ask an element to stretch until the end
      of the grid. In this case it only stretched to the end of the 3x3 grid
      that was specified directly, but it does not stretch over the implicit
      lines created automatically by grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "sheep" element is instead starting at the value of "auto" and ending
      at column line 4. This will give the item an automatic span of 1.
    </p>

    <h4>Align Elements in the Grid</h4>

    <p>
      Now that we now how to create grids and place elements in the grid, we
      might want to have more control on how these elements are spaced and look
      like: you need to control their alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quickest way to choose how a specific element will align its own
      content in the grid is using the "place-self" command.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is actually a shorthand for two other commands called "align-self" and
      "justify-self" in one, so let's see this shortcut in action.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      .item-a { <br />
      place-self: center stretch; }
    </div>

    <p>
      The command "place-self" takes two values: the first one (align-self) will
      choose how the item will align vertically, along the column. The second
      value (justify-self) will choose how to justify the item along the row.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are 5 commands that you can choose both for aligning items
      vertically or horizontally:
    </p>

    <div class="space placeSelf1">
      <div class="boxB">auto</div>
      <div class="boxB">auto</div>
      <div class="boxB">auto</div>
      <div class="boxB">auto</div>
      <div class="boxB">auto</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="align-self: auto;">align-self: auto</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="align-self: start;">start</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="align-self: end;">end</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="align-self: center;">center</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="align-self: stretch;">stretch</div>
      <div class="boxA" style="justify-self: auto;">justify-self: auto</div>
      <div class="boxA" style="justify-self: start;">start</div>
      <div class="boxA" style="justify-self: end;">end</div>
      <div class="boxA" style="justify-self: center;">center</div>
      <div class="boxA" style="justify-self: stretch;">stretch</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="place-self: auto;">place-self: auto</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="place-self: start;">start</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="place-self: end;">end</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="place-self: center;">center</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="place-self: stretch;">stretch</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="place-self: auto center;">
        place-self: auto center
      </div>
      <div class="boxC" style="place-self: start end;">start end</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="place-self: end stretch;">end stretch</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="place-self: center end;">center end</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="place-self: stretch start;">stretch start</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      On the first row we can see how the grid would look like without any
      alignment. <br />
      On the second row we find the 5 possible values applied to align-self.
      Worth noticing how while both auto and stretch look the same, the
      difference is that while stretch is independent, auto will copy its parent
      element. So typically if an alignment for the whole grid has been
      specified, auto will copy it for the element itself (it's the default
      behaviour without any custom alignment). <br />
      Third row contains all 5 examples of justify-self. <br />
      The fourth row displays both align and justify being modified at once with
      the place-self shortcut. In this case by choosing only one value on place
      itself we are setting both align and justify to the same value, but they
      can be chosen differently, like shown in the fifth row.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3 id="advancedGrid">What more can you do with a Grid Container?</h3>

    <h4>Customize the alignment of the Grid itself</h4>
    <p>
      We have seen how to select different alignments for the elements in a
      grid, but even the grid itself can be changed in many ways. In many ways
      this is a bit like setting the whole grid to behave in a certain way
      instead of a single element. You can always customize a single element to
      behave differently though, like shown above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the shorthand to set up both the vertical alignment and
      horizontal justifying in one command here too: "place-items". It takes the
      exact same values shown above for place-self, minus "auto" which is not
      used here. <br />Let's see some small grids showing the various
      possibilities.

      These are basically the exact same customization available with
      place-self, but applied to the whole grid with just one command.
    </p>

    <p class="bold space">place-content</p>

    <p>
      There is another shorthand to customize the placing of a whole grid
      though: <br />
      "place-content".
    </p>
    <p>
      If the previous command was useful to align every item inside a grid,
      "place-content" instead allows you to move the entire grid and to align on
      the page. In addition to the four commands seen above, place-content
      supports even three more. <br />
      Just like in the previous examples, writing only one value will apply it
      to both alignment and justify, but they can be specified separately. Let's
      see.

    <h4>Renaming lines and areas</h4>

    <p class="space">
      An interesting function of grid is the ability to give your own name to
      lines, instead of referring to to cells as "Row 1, Column 1" as we did
      above.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      .frExample{ <br />
      <br />
      grid-template-columns: [column-1] 500px [column-2] 1fr; <br />
      <br />
      grid-template-rows: [row-1] 1fr [row-2] 3fr; }
    </div>

    <p>
      By choosing a name and writing it before the dimension, surrounded by [ ],
      you can now refer to that specific line with the name you've chosen. You
      could even give more than one name to a line like this "[column-start
      column-end] 500px".
    </p>

    <p>
      This even works with the repeat function, which can automatically name
      things (with the same name though).
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      .gridContainer { <br />
      grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 20px [col-start]); }
    </div>

    <h4>Dividing the Grid in areas</h4>
    <p>
      An alternative way to place items around the grid is by first assigning a
      name to one or more cells, and then assign the element we want to that
      area. Let's see how to create an area first.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      .gridAreas { <br />
      <br />
      grid-template: 1fr 2fr 1fr / 1fr 2fr 1fr; <br />
      <br />
      grid-template-areas: <br />"side header header" ". main main" "footer
      footer footer"; }
    </div>

    <p>
      Here we first defined a simple 3x2 grid structure with "grid-template".
      Then we assigned to each of those cells a name.
    </p>

    <div class="space gridAreas">
      <div class="boxA" style="grid-area: header;">Header</div>
      <div class="boxC" style="grid-area: footer;">Footer</div>
      <div class="boxB" style="grid-area: side;">Side</div>
      <div class="boxD" style="grid-area: main;">Main</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      &lt;div class="gridAreas"&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxA" style="grid-area: header;"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;
      <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxC" style="grid-area: footer;"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;
      <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxB" style="grid-area: side;"&gt;Side&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      &lt;div class="boxD" style="grid-area: main;"&gt;Main&lt;/div&gt; <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
      By assigning to an element the desired grid area the element will then
      occupy the desired cells. A period "." can be used to leave a cell empty,
      although they shouldn't be used to separate two instances of the same
      area.
    </p>

    <h4>Controlling Grid implicit lines</h4>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, when there are more elements in a grid than the grid
      is able to place around, it will automatically extend itself to fit them
      in. <br />There is actually some degree of control on how these extra
      lines are created by using "grid-auto-columns" and "grid-auto-rows". Let's
      see by creating a 2x2 grid with 100px wide cells, but inserting an extra
      element.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      grid-template: 100px 100px / 100px 100px; <br />
      grid-auto-columns: 50px; <br />
      grid-auto-rows: 150px;
    </div>

    <div
      style="display:grid; grid-template: 100px 100px / 100px 100px; grid-auto-columns: 50px; grid-auto-rows: 150px;"
    >
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxC">Auto Grid</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      We have specified that every auto element should be created as a column of
      50px and row of 150px. But the column size is still clearly 100px, so
      what's happening? <br />
      What's happening is that Grid is currently set to create auto elements as
      rows (the default behaviour)! We can actually change that though, with
      "grid-auto-flow".
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see the same example, but this time we will specify that new
      elements should be placed in columns.
    </p>

    <div
      style="display:grid; grid-template: 100px 100px / 100px 100px; grid-auto-columns: 50px; grid-auto-rows: 150px; grid-auto-flow: column;"
    >
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxB">Actual Grid</div>
      <div class="boxC">Auto Grid</div>
    </div>

    <div class="code">grid-auto-flow: column;</div>

    <p>
      Other than "row" and "column" there is also a third value called "dense"
      that is supported by grid-auto-flow. It basically asks the grid to try to
      fill any empty space as soon as possible, by using elements that could fit
      in the space.
    </p>

    <h2 class="space">Finally: Play with Grid</h2>

    <p>
      Of course there is no better way to understand these concepts than to try
      them out when you need them, but until then there is a simple way to get
      some practice: play a game!
